    <h1>Privacy Policy – WellTrack</h1>
    <div class="updated">Last Updated: January 2025</div>

    <p>
        WellTrack (“the App”) is designed to help users track meals, blood pressure, medication
        intake, workouts, and other personal health-related information while ensuring full privacy.
        This Privacy Policy explains how your information is handled when using the App.
    </p>

    <h2>1. No Data Collection</h2>
    <p>
        The App does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, transmit, or share any personal information.
        The App functions fully offline and does not connect to any server, cloud service,
        analytics platform, or third-party provider.
    </p>

    <h2>2. All Data Stays on Your Device</h2>
    <p>
        All information entered into the App is stored <strong>locally on your device only</strong>.
        No data is visible to or accessible by the developer or any external party.
        Your data never leaves your device unless you choose to export or share it.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Backups & Exported JSON Files</h2>
    <p>
        The App allows users to export their data as a JSON file for backup purposes.
        These files are generated locally and never transmitted or uploaded by the App.
        Users retain full control over whether and how they share these files.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Doctor Report PDFs</h2>
    <p>
        The App can generate PDF reports summarizing logged health data. These PDFs are produced
        offline and are not uploaded or transmitted anywhere. Users are solely responsible for
        sharing these reports with third parties if they choose to do so.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Permissions</h2>
    <p>
        The App may request device permissions strictly for functionality:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Storage / File Access:</strong> For saving or importing backups and PDFs.</li>
        <li><strong>Camera / Photos (optional):</strong> For capturing prescription images.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        These permissions are used solely for the intended features and never for data collection.
    </p>

    <h2>6. No Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        The App does not use analytics, advertising networks, cloud services, social logins, or
        any third-party SDKs that process personal data.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>
        Users may delete their data at any time using features within the App or by uninstalling
        the App, which removes all data stored on the device.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        Since the App does not collect or process any information, it is safe for use by individuals
        of all ages. Parents or guardians are responsible for supervising usage.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        If future updates require changes to this policy, a revised version will be included in a
        future App update. Because the App is offline, changes do not affect previously stored data.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Contact</h2>
